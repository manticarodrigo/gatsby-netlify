## COMMITMENTS TO IMPROVE DIVERSITY

Agencies have key strategic partners like Google to support them with trainings, event participation, and brand exposure. For Google, their employees come from different backgrounds and experiences and do their best work, because their differences are embraced in an inclusive environment. Google's four commitments to improve diversity and inclusion are:

> * Share progress toward a more representative company
> * Expand access to careers in technology
> * Strengthen the community outreach
> * Broaden supplier's network and create inclusive products

These commitments can help any Agency that is constantly improving their team diversity and that also is expanding to new market segments.
